					Hello! My name is Shraddha.
					<br />
					<br />

					I was born in India, and moved to the US when I was about 5. I grew up
					in Ithaca, NY and moved to Potomac, MD for middle school and onwards.
					Then, I went to Wellesley College. I majored in math and economics and
					graduated in May 2021.
					<br />

					<!-- <br />
					All through Wellesley, I was very interested in pursuing a career in
					academia in Economics since it would allow me to study our world
					analytically and use data to answer questions about peoples’
					day-to-day lives. Thus, I worked as a research assistant to various
					math and economics professors since my first summer of college and got
					the opportunity to work with extremely large datasets. I was
					fascinated by the vast amount of data we had at our fingertips and
					really wanted to use it to effectively to answer interesting questions
					about the world. But, I was noticing that it was hard to do so without
					having strong computer science skills to manipulate the data. So, I
					worked on mastering R and Stata (the two most commonly used programs
					in economics and statistics).
					<br />
					<br />
					So after graduation, I still wanted to pursue a career in Economics
					but was more aware of the fact that I needed to work on my programming
					skills to be as productive as possible. So while working at Harvard
					Business School as a research associate, I tried to teach myself
					various programing languages like SQL and C to be a more effective
					worker.
					<br />
					<br />
					At HBS, I was working on a research project which aimed to understand
					how the #meToo movement differed across sectors using Twitter data.
					The biggest challenge was to map Twitter users to job sectors using
					the information the users provide in their bios. Since we had millions
					of data points, we would have to use programming tools and machine
					learning models to accomplish this task. So I spent the past year
					researching models and papers and attempting to implement them, along
					with other research associate tasks such as literature review and copy
					editing. During this time, I became even more convinced that to truly
					harness the power of the immense amount of data we have access to now,
					I needed to be a much better programmer. Even though I had developed a
					strong background in R and Stata, I needed formal training to become
					as effective of a programmer as possible. Thus, I decided to enroll in
					General Assembly’s Immersive Software Engineering program.
					<br />
					<br />
					After this program, I really hope to combine my background in
					statistics and data science from undergrad and my new programming
					skills to understand the world a little bit better. As of right now,
					we have access to more data and more types of data than we have ever
					had before. I really want to keep learning to be a better seeker of
					answers using data and computer science.
