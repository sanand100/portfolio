						<p>Hello! My name is Shraddha.</p>
						<p>
							I was born in India, and moved to the US when I was about 5. I
							grew up in Ithaca, NY and Potomac, MD. I graduated from Wellesley
							College in May 2021 with a double major in mathematics and
							economics.
						</p>
						<p>
							At Wellesley, I had the unique opportunity to be a
							cross-registered student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
							Along with taking classes at MIT's economics department, I also
							participated in MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program
							(UROP) and worked under the guidance of various economics
							professors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through working as a UROP research assistant at MIT, as well as
							other research assistantships at Wellesley, I got the opportunity
							to work with extremely large datasets. I was fascinated by the
							vast amount of data we had at our fingertips and wanted to use it
							to effectively to answer interesting questions about the world. A
							strong background in computer science was needed to be an
							effective researcher and manipulate the large datasets. So, I
							worked on mastering R and Stata (the two most commonly used
							programs in economics and statistics).
						</p>
						<p>
							After graduation, I wanted to pursue a career in Economics
							research but was more aware of the fact that I needed to work on
							my programming skills to be as productive as possible. So while
							working at Harvard Business School as a research associate, I
							taught myself various programing languages like SQL and C to be a
							more effective worker.
						</p>
						<p>
							At HBS, I was working on a research project which aimed to
							understand how the #meToo movement differed across sectors using
							Twitter data. The biggest challenge was to map Twitter users to
							job sectors using the information the users provide in their bios.
							Since we had millions of data points, we knew we had to use
							programming tools and machine learning models to accomplish this
							task. I spent the past year researching models and papers and
							attempting to implement them. During this time, I became even more
							convinced that to truly harness the power of the immense amount of
							data we have access to now, I needed to be a much better
							programmer. Even though I had developed a strong background in R
							and Stata, I needed formal training to become as effective of a
							programmer as possible. Thus, I decided to enroll in General
							Assemblyâ€™s Immersive Software Engineering program.
						</p>
						<p>
							After this program, I really hope to combine my background in
							statistics and data science from undergrad and my new programming
							skills to understand the world a little bit better. As of right
							now, we have access to more data and more types of data than we
							have ever had before and I want to take advantage of this to study
							interesting problems. I want to keep learning to be a better
							seeker of answers using data and computer science.
